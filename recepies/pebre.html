  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>How can I describe this. Well, as you might guess is a sauce, or dressing
    as you anglos call it. When I was living in the US someone asked me. Isn't
    that just pico de gallo? I haven't spoke to them since. Pebre is a classic
    chilean dressing, it goes with everything. Empanada? Yes. Bread? Yes. Sopaipilla?
    Yes please. I could go on.

    I wanted to share this recepie since it's one of my favorites, and I wish I 
    had the inclination to prepare it more often. It's just a bit sad that
    something that takes a while to make, can be gone in mere minutes.
