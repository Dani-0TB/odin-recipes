  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pancakes are a <em>classic</em> breakfast recepie. One of my favourites and
    easy for anyone to do. It's also light on the wallet, but not any less delicous.
    This recepie is not that common where I come from, but when I saw them on TV I
    knew I had to try them.
  </p>
  <p>This is a <strong>simple</strong> recepie, perfect for all ages, maybe you have a kid who
    wants to help in the kitchen? They can certainly help you with most of it.
    Afterwards you can serve them with syrup, jam, ice cream, fruit... Your 
    imagination is the limit!
