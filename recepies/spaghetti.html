  <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese <em>(Vegan)</em></h1>
  <p>Just like my mom used to make em... Well, almost.</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recepie is also a classic and one of my favorites to make. It's
    a bit more elaborate, but when you get it down, it can take at 
    <strong>most</strong> 30 minutes of total cook time. Also since there is
    basically just one ingredient that has to be replaced for this to be vegan,
    most people can't even tell the differece if you make it right.
  </p>
  <p>One of my favorite things about this dish, is that I never get enough. If
    I had the stomach to take it, I would eat this every single day and not
    get bored. Every preparation can be a bit different, and don't be shy to
    try some extra ingredients out. Especially to season the Soy Protein.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, diced</li>
    <li>160ml vegan-friendly red wine</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>100g closed cup mushrooms, diced</li>
    <li>1 aubergine, diced</li>
    <li>75g lentilles vertes</li>
    <li>2 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 Kallo Organic vegetable stock cube</li>
    <li>300g spaghetti, to serve</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbsp almond milk</li>
    <li>fresh basil, to serve (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the onion, celery and carrot and cook gently for 10 mins, stirring 
      regularly, until softened.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour in the wine and let it reduce for 2-3 mins then stir in the
      garlic, tomato purée, vinegar and oregano. Cook for 1 min, then add the 
      mushrooms, aubergine, lentils, chopped tomatoes, stock cube and 200ml water.</li>
    <li>
      Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Cover the pan 
      loosely and cook for 40-50 mins until the sauce has thickened to your 
      desired consistency. Stir often and add a splash more water if the sauce 
      starts to catch on the bottom of the pan. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the 
      pasta to pack instructions. To serve, stir the soy sauce and almond milk 
      into the sauce and spoon over the drained pasta. Garnish with a few fresh 
      basil leaves, if you like. 
    </li>
  </ol>
