Recepies website project for The Odin Proeject Course

## What is this?

Well, I'm trying to solidify my web dev knowledge by working with a bit more
structure. So although I already have experience programming and the bunch,
I will be doing every project, my mindset is, nothing is "too basic", just
do it and get some practice. So, this projects demonstrates some basic HTML
familiarity with it's structure and elements including:

* HTML boilerplate
* Headings
* Paragraphs
* Images
* Lists
* Links

Also I'll be practicing with git version control, project structure, and I'm
going to try and make it look decent with just HTML markup.
